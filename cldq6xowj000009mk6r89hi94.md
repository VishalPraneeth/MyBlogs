# DevOps Project to Host a static website on AWS using Terraform automation.

### Problem statement:

* Create the private key and security group which allows port 80.
    
* Launch Amazon AWS EC2 instance.
    
* In this EC2 instance use the key and security group which we have created in step 1 to log in remotely or locally.
    
* Launch one Volume (EBS) and mount that volume into /var/www/html.
    
* The code is uploaded into the GitHub repo also the repo has an image.
    
* Copy the GitHub repo code into /var/www/html.
    
* Create an S3 bucket, copy/deploy the image from the GitHub repo into the s3 bucket and change the permission to public readable.
    
* Create a Cloudfront using an S3 bucket(which contains image) and use the Cloudfront URL to update in code in /var/www/html.
    

Prerequisites: Having an AWS account, installing the latest version of AWS CLI on your machine, and installing the latest version of Terraform.

## The language used in Terraform is HCL(HashiCorp Language) and "you don't have to be perfect in that language to use it in your project".

### Step 1: Create an IAM role in AWS, download the access key pair, and configure it through your AWS CLI.

```bash
aws configure --profile name
aws configure list-profiles
```

## Step 2: S*et up the provider for terraform i.e. AWS, and log in to our console AWS using the profile configured.*

```bash
//Describing Provider
provider "aws" {
  region  = "ap-south-1"
  profile = "vishal"
}
```

## Step 3:*Generating a key, and key-value pair, and save it as a .pem file in the system.*

```bash
//Creating Key
resource "tls_private_key" "tls_key" {
  algorithm = "RSA"
}

//Generating Key-Value Pair
resource "aws_key_pair" "generated_key" {
  key_name   = "vishal1-env-key"
  public_key = "${tls_private_key.tls_key.public_key_openssh}"
  
  depends_on = [
    tls_private_key.tls_key
  ]
}


//Saving Private Key PEM File
resource "local_file" "key-file" {
  content  = "${tls_private_key.tls_key.private_key_pem}"
  filename = "vishal1-env-key.pem"
  
  depends_on = [
    tls_private_key.tls_key
  ]
}
```

## Step 4: Create the variable ID for AMI \[Amazon machine image\], and Type as t2 which is free tier.

```bash
//Creating Variable for AMI_ID
variable "ami_id" {
  type    = string
  default = "ami-0447a12f28fddb066"
}

//Creating Variable for AMI_Type
variable "ami_type" {
  type    = string
  default = "t2.micro"
}
```

## Step 5: Creating security groups for EC2 instance.

```bash
//Creating Security Group
resource "aws_security_group" "web-SG" {
  name        = "Terraform-SG"
  description = "Web Environment Security Group"


  //Adding Rules to Security Group 
  ingress {
    description = "SSH Rule"
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }


  ingress {
    description = "HTTP Rule"
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

## Step 6: Create an S3 \[Simple storage service\] bucket in public-read access mode and upload an image into it.

```bash
//Creating a S3 Bucket for Terraform Integration
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "vishal-bucket" {
  bucket = "vishal-static-data-bucket"
  acl    = "public-read"
}

//Putting Objects in S3 Bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket_object" "web-object1" {
  bucket = "${aws_s3_bucket.vishal-bucket.bucket}"
  key    = "vishal.png"
  source = "/home/vishal/Desktop/terr/vishal.png"
  acl    = "public-read"
}
```

## Step 7: Create and launch the instance with the name "web".

```bash
//Launching EC2 Instance
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami             = "${var.ami_id}"
  instance_type   = "${var.ami_type}"
  key_name        = "${aws_key_pair.generated_key.key_name}"
  security_groups = ["${aws_security_group.web-SG.name}","default"]

  //Labelling the Instance
  tags = {
    Name = "Web-Env"
    env  = "Production"
  } 

  depends_on = [
    aws_security_group.web-SG,
    aws_key_pair.generated_key
  ]
}

```

## Step 8: *Final Step is to create a website using the null resource, local\_exec, remote\_exec, and Volume to store data.*

```bash
resource "null_resource" "remote1" {
  
  depends_on = [ aws_instance.web, ]
  //Executing Commands to initiate WebServer in Instance Over SSH 
  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    connection {
      agent       = "false"
      type        = "ssh"
      user        = "ec2-user"
      private_key = "${tls_private_key.tls_key.private_key_pem}"
      host        = "${aws_instance.web.public_ip}"
    }
    
    inline = [
      "sudo yum install httpd git -y",
      "sudo systemctl start httpd",
      "sudo systemctl enable httpd",
    ]

}

}

//Creating EBS Volume
resource "aws_ebs_volume" "web-vol" {
  availability_zone = "${aws_instance.web.availability_zone}"
  size              = 1
  
  tags = {
    Name = "ebs-vol"
  }
}


//Attaching EBS Volume to a Instance
resource "aws_volume_attachment" "ebs_att" {
  device_name  = "/dev/sdh"
  volume_id    = "${aws_ebs_volume.web-vol.id}"
  instance_id  = "${aws_instance.web.id}"
  force_detach = true 


  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    connection {
      agent       = "false"
      type        = "ssh"
      user        = "ec2-user"
      private_key = "${tls_private_key.tls_key.private_key_pem}"
      host        = "${aws_instance.web.public_ip}"
    }
    
    inline = [
      "sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdh",
      "sudo mount /dev/xvdh /var/www/html/",
      "sudo rm -rf /var/www/html/*",
      "sudo git clone https://github.com/VishalPraneeth/Terraform-AWS.git /var/www/html/",
    ]
  }


  depends_on = [
    aws_instance.web,
    aws_ebs_volume.web-vol
  ]
}
```

We're using a null resource for remote execution, through ssh with root access to install any required software packages. And therefore git and httpd have been installed through commands.

## Step 9: EBS *Snapshot Creation and Attachment*

```bash
 //Creating EBS Snapshot
resource "aws_ebs_snapshot" "ebs_snapshot" {
  volume_id   = "${aws_ebs_volume.web-vol.id}"
  description = "Snapshot of our EBS volume"
  
  tags = {
    env = "Production"
  }
  depends_on = [
    aws_volume_attachment.ebs_att
  ]
}

# public ip
output "IP_of_inst" {
  value = aws_instance.web.public_ip
}
```

We're creating a backup of our volume with ebs snapshot, and can be used when we require the data.

### Store this whole code in one file named [***filename.tf***](http://filename.tf) and execute using the below commands, It takes time to build such a huge infrastructure so be patient and try to understand the output.

```bash
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan 
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

Let's see the services we've created with this code.

It's time for us now to delete/destroy the infrastructure.

## Just run the below command to destroy

```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

The output:
