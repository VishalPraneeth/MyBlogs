### What is WebAssembly?

It is a low-level binary web format compiled from other languages to offer maximized performance and augment JS.

### Advantages and use cases of WebAssembly

1. Reliable and better performance
    
2. Enhanced portability
    
3. Greater flexibility
    
4. It is available on all Browsers
    

### How does WebAssembly work?

![Web Assembly Demystified: A Comprehensive Overview](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1671551169004/yvBNPICfy.png align="left")

It works by compiling code from languages like Go, C++, or Rust into a compact binary format. This binary format is executed by the browser's WebAssembly engine. This engine translates the WebAssembly instructions into machine code that can be executed directly by the computer's processor. This allows WebAssembly to run at high speed, making it highly efficient.

### Tooling used in WASM

![WebAssemblyとは？できること・できないこと・使い方をわかりやすく解説 ｜パーソルクロステクノロジー](https://staff.persol-xtech.co.jp/hatalabo/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/it641_03.jpg align="left")

There are tools available for compiling and optimizing WebAssembly code, like the Emscripten compiler. Development environments and IDEs like WebAssembly Studio provide a comfortable coding experience for working.

### WASM and Languages

WebAssembly can be used with different programming languages, not just JavaScript. It allows developers to write code in Go, C++, Rust, and many other languages and compile them into WebAssembly modules. WebAssembly modules can then be integrated into web applications, working alongside JavaScript code.

### WASM in the Browser

![Where is WebAssembly now and what's next? - Mozilla Hacks - the Web  developer blog](https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2017/02/logo_party01.png align="left")

WebAssembly is loaded and executed within the web browser alongside JavaScript. Its modules can communicate with JavaScript using a simple interface.

### WASM and Web APIs

WebAssembly can interact with various browser APIs like WebGL for 3D graphics or WebAudio for audio processing. This allows developers to build complex and interactive web applications using WebAssembly alongside these APIs.

### Security Considerations

It has built-in security features that isolate its execution from the rest of the web page. By running in a sandboxed environment, it helps prevent malicious code from causing harm.

### Real-world Examples
